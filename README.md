# 12 SQL Employee Tracker

## Description 
For the module 12 assignment I built an employee tracker in JavaScript. Employee information is stored in a MYSQL database. The application uses Node along with the Inquirer package to display employee information by collecting user input via the command line. 

A demo of the tool can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lmHHUdttrpCwnjJ6D9-raFWV9wHvpCvH/view

## Installation
To install node on mac, use `brew install nvm` and `nvm install 16`.
Use `npm install` to install the MYSQL2 and inquirer package along with the other required packages.

## Usage
The user will need to type `node index.js` on the command line to launch a manu. The user can view and update department, role, and employee information.

## User Story

```

I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Acceptance Criteria
